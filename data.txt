hello Sandeep Kumar Patel 
welcome to the aws Jenkins 

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among rolling green hills, 
there lived a young boy named Ethan. 
Ethan had always dreamt of exploring the world beyond his village. 
One sunny morning, he decided to set off on an adventure. 
With a backpack filled with snacks and a map in hand, Ethan waved goodbye to his family and friends. 
As he journeyed through dense forests and crossed babbling brooks, 
Ethan encountered friendly animals and magical sights. As the sun began to set, 
Ethan found himself atop a hill, marveling at the breathtaking sunset painting the sky. 
With a heart full of wonder and memories to last a lifetime, 
Ethan returned home, eager to share his tales of adventure with his loved ones. 
And from that day on, Ethan's spirit of curiosity and exploration inspired 
others in the village to embark on their own adventures, 
making their small corner of the world a little brighter.
